# VladaVoronina_CSC_51074_EP
This repository contains homework solutions for the CSC 51074 - Shape Representation and Analysis course. The course covers the fundamental concepts of shape generation, representation, and analysis in 2D and 3D, focusing on techniques such as parametric curves, triangle meshes, shape matching, and retrieval.
# Course Topics

Coordinate Systems & Transformations: Affine & Projective transformations, homogeneous coordinates.
Curves Representation: Parametric & implicit curves, Bézier curves, De Casteljau algorithm.
3D Shape Representations: Triangle meshes, subdivision surfaces, point clouds.
Shape Processing & Analysis: Simplification, segmentation, curvature detection, vector field processing.
Shape Matching & Retrieval: Rigid registration, non-rigid matching, correspondences, data-driven methods.
